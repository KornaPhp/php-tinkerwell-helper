# Tinkerwell Helper

Immediately open [Tinkerwell](https://tinkerwell.app) from within your Laravel applications. Think of it as a `dd` on steroids.

## Installation


**This package only works with Tinkerwell for macOS**

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require --dev beyondcode/tinkerwell-helper
```

## Usage

> Note: You need Tinkerwell version 2.2.0+ in order to use this package.

Use the `tinker` method to open Tinkerwell with the given variables available in the Tinkerwell scope.

For example:
``` php
$user = User::find(1);

tinker($user);
```

This will open Tinkerwell and you will have the `$user` variable available within Tinkerwell immediately.

You can also tinker with data that is not explicitly in a temporary variable:

``` php
tinker(User::find(1));
```

In this case, the scoped variable(s) are named `$temp0`, `$temp1`, etc.
